# 👋 Hi, I'm Yengkong  

Mechanical Design Engineer transitioning into **Industrial Reliability & Digital Systems Engineering**. I build **physics-based simulation, failure prediction, and production performance models** using Python and C++ to support reliability engineering, predictive maintenance, and data-driven design decisions.

---

## 🔹 What I Do  

- **Reliability Engineering Modeling** — thermal analysis, fatigue life prediction, MTBF forecasting  
- **Digital Twins & Simulation** — physics-based system modeling for failure prevention  
- **Industrial Data & Analytics** — production risk, uptime forecasting, performance bottleneck analysis  
- **Mechanical Systems Engineering** — manufacturing documentation, configuration control, and production validation
